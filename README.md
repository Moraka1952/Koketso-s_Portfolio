## **Portfolio of Koketso (Machine Learning Junior Data Scientist)**

### **1. CO2 Emission Prediction in Agri-food Sector**  
**Overview**:  
In this project, I worked as part of a team of environmental consultants and data scientists, tasked with analyzing and predicting CO2 emissions from the agri-food sector. We used data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to explore various emission sources and develop predictive models for temperature variations in the sector.  
By performing regression analysis, we aimed to offer actionable insights for policymakers, agricultural businesses, and environmental organizations to mitigate climate change. The project was critical in promoting sustainable practices within the agri-food sector.  
**Key Responsibilities**:  
- Data wrangling and cleaning of the dataset.  
- Regression analysis for CO2 emission predictions.  
- Developed a model to predict temperature variations.  
- Delivered insights to improve sustainability in agriculture.

### **2. River Health and Pollution Management Platform**  
**Overview**:  
In this project, I worked on a platform aimed at providing a comprehensive view of river health and identifying pollution sources in the water industry. By incorporating predictive analytics, expanding chemical monitoring, and improving the understanding of seasonal effects on pollutant concentrations, this platform empowers stakeholders with data-backed insights for informed decision-making and effective policy development.  
**Key Responsibilities**:  
- Data analysis on river health and pollution sources.  
- Implementation of predictive models for river health monitoring.  
- Developed actionable insights to improve river pollution management.

### **3. Anime Recommendation System**  
**Overview**:  
This project focuses on developing an Anime Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques. I utilized **Streamlit** for creating an interactive and user-friendly interface to recommend anime based on user preferences.  
**Key Responsibilities**:  
- Built the recommendation system using machine learning algorithms.  
- Developed the front-end using Streamlit for user interaction.  
- Worked on implementing both collaborative and content-based filtering methods.

### **4. Avocado Price Prediction**  
**Overview**:  
In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict the average price of avocados over five years in the USA. I used **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** and **Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning** to compare model performances.  
**Key Responsibilities**:  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for price prediction.  
- Implemented multiple models (MLR and Random Forest) and compared their performance.  
- Focused on optimizing the Random Forest model using hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
